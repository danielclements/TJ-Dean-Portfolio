# TJ Dean Tattoo Portfolio

This project came to light as a good friend of mine is an apprentice tattoo artist and he wanted a way to show the world his work.   
I wanted to build him a webpage where not only could he display his art work, but a place where people can find out all the information needed when choosing a new tattoo artist. 
As Tj progresses so will the web page, In the future people will be able to see his progression through the portfolio section.

 
## UX
 
For this project I wanted to create a sight that was easy to navigate and had all the information no more than 2 clicks away, for that reason I decided to go for a single page design broken in to different sections as I believe this also creates a smoother experience for the user.  

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

- Landing section: With this page the goal was to create a minimalistic landing that on first glance a user would be able to get a general feel for the webpage. With the help of the nav bar located at the top of the page the user would be able to navigate to the desired page with out having to scroll through the entire page.  

- Portfolio Section: The goal with this page was to display all of Tj's art work in one place, With the use of FancyBox this allowed me to create a clean and easy to navigate image gallery.  

- Testimonial Section : This page has a simple goal in mind, To display the comments left by previous clients. Not only does this build credibility but also reassures the user that Tj has the skills needed to give them the tattoo experience they deserve.  

- Bio Section: With this page I wanted the user to be able to familiarize them selves with Tj and a little bit about him and his background. Added social media links so the user can connect with him online.  

- FAQ section: On this page you will find a list of frequently asked questions. My goal with this page was to compile all the FAQs a tattoo artist would get, the goal is to educate the user straight away instead of having them wait for Tj to reply to a email, with this it stop the user losing interest.  

- Contact: This page was built so the user can ask any questions that may not be on the FAQ page, This fully functional form was built using bootstrap and also allows the user to upload a file if they want to reference a specific design when enquiring about a Tattoo.  

- Location/Hours Section: With this page the user will be able to find where the tattoo studio is located and  and what the opening hours are along with further contact details.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
